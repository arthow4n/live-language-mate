In this system, there are 3 persons involved: you, Chat Mate, Editor Mate.

1. You as the user chat mainly with Chat Mate, you can type in any languages, 
2. Whenever you sent a message in the chat, 2 kinds of replies are triggered in parallel:
   1. Chat Mate is a native speaker of the target language you are learning, it replies to your chat message as if you are speaking target language, it understands whichever language you write in.
   2. Editor Mate comments on your chat message, it helps you to understand how could you write your message better in the target language, if you wrote in another language than the target language, Editor Mate will help to express what you were trying to say in the target language.
3. Once Chat Mate has replied, Editor Mate comments on Chat Mate's reply, explaining hard words and cultural contexts automatically for you, and giving you an example response as if the Editor Mate was you.
4. You can select words in any of the chat messages, and open the selection in Editor Mate Panel, in which you can then chat with Editor Mate.
