/**
 * Data Persistence Workflow Tests
 *
 * These tests would verify data persistence and storage functionality.
 * Currently skipped due to test environment complexity with full app context providers.
 *
 * Test scenarios to implement:
 * 1. Conversation persistence across app restarts
 * 2. Settings persistence across sessions
 * 3. Conversation isolation - multiple conversations maintain separate data
 * 4. Storage corruption recovery - handles invalid data gracefully
 * 5. Large conversation handling - performance with many messages
